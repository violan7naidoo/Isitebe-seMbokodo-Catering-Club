# Payment Method Selection Fix ✅

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

The issue was that clicking on payment method options was causing a page reload instead of just updating the selection. This was happening because of form submission behavior with the RadioGroup component.

### **Root Cause:**
- The RadioGroup component was triggering form submission
- Any radio button implementation was causing page reloads
- Form elements were interfering with click handling

## 🛠️ **Changes Made:**

### **1. Replaced Radio Buttons with Button Cards:**
- **Before:** Used RadioGroup and custom radio buttons which caused form submission
- **After:** Created button-based selection using actual Button components

### **2. Button-Based Selection:**
```typescript
// Button-based selection - no form interference
<Button
  variant={selectedMethod === method.id ? "default" : "outline"}
  className={`w-full h-auto p-4 flex flex-col items-start space-y-2 ${
    selectedMethod === method.id 
      ? 'bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white border-blue-600' 
      : 'hover:bg-gray-50'
  }`}
  onClick={() => handleMethodChange(method.id)}
  disabled={!method.isAvailable}
>
```

### **3. Grid Layout:**
- **Added:** Responsive grid layout (1 column on mobile, 2 on desktop)
- **Improved:** Better visual organization of payment options

### **4. Visual Status Indicator:**
- **Added:** Orange alert card when payment method is changed
- **Shows:** Clear indication that changes need to be saved

### **5. Enhanced User Experience:**
- **Clear Selection:** Selected button is highlighted in blue
- **Disabled State:** Unavailable options are properly disabled
- **Hover Effects:** Smooth transitions and hover states

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

### **1. Selection Process:**
1. User clicks on any payment method option
2. `handleMethodChange` is called with the selected method
3. State is updated immediately (no page reload)
4. UI reflects the new selection

### **2. Save Process:**
1. User clicks "Save Payment Method" button
2. Form submission is handled by `handleFormSubmit`
3. `preventDefault()` prevents page reload
4. API call is made to update payment method
5. Success/error feedback is shown

## 🚀 **Expected Behavior:**

- ✅ **No Page Reload** - Selection changes without page refresh
- ✅ **Immediate UI Update** - Selected option is highlighted immediately
- ✅ **Save Button** - Only enabled when method changes
- ✅ **Form Submission** - Proper form handling with preventDefault
- ✅ **API Integration** - Payment method is saved to database

## 🔍 **Debugging:**

The component now includes console logs to help debug:
- `console.log('Method changing to:', method)` - When selection changes
- `console.log('Saving payment method:', selectedMethod)` - When saving

## 📋 **Test Steps:**

1. **Open browser console** to see debug logs
2. **Click different payment methods** - Should see selection change without reload
3. **Click "Save Payment Method"** - Should see save operation in console
4. **Check database** - Payment method should be updated

The payment method selection should now work smoothly without page reloads! 🎉
