# Payments Page Creation ✅

## 🎯 **What I Created:**

### **1. Dedicated Payments Page**
- **Location:** `/dashboard/payments`
- **Features:** Complete payment management system
- **Navigation:** Tabbed interface with Overview, Payment Methods, Banking Details, Make Payment

### **2. Updated Navigation**
- **Sidebar:** Added "Payments" link with Banknote icon
- **Header:** Added "Payments" link in mobile navigation
- **Order:** Dashboard → Membership → **Payments** → Profile → Settings

### **3. Cleaned Membership Page**
- **Removed:** All payment-related components and sections
- **Kept:** Core membership information and management
- **Added:** "Manage Payments" button that links to payments page

## 🛠️ **Pages Structure:**

### **Membership Page (`/dashboard/membership`):**
- ✅ **Membership Details** - Plan, status, dates
- ✅ **Quick Actions** - Update Profile, Manage Payments, Change Plan
- ✅ **Deactivate Membership** - Danger zone at bottom
- ❌ **Removed** - Payment methods, banking details, payment forms

### **Payments Page (`/dashboard/payments`):**
- ✅ **Overview Tab** - Membership summary and quick actions
- ✅ **Payment Methods Tab** - Select payment method (no page reload issues)
- ✅ **Banking Details Tab** - Manage banking information
- ✅ **Make Payment Tab** - PayFast integration

## 🎨 **User Experience:**

1. **Dashboard** → Overview of everything
2. **Membership** → Manage membership details

4. **Profile** → Personal information
5. **Settings** → Account settings

### **Payment Management:**
