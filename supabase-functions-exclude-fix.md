# Supabase Functions Exclude Fix ✅

## 🐛 **The Problem:**

TypeScript error during build:
```
Cannot find name 'Deno'.
```

This happened because Next.js was trying to compile the Supabase Edge Function file (`supabase/functions/generate-membership-number/index.ts`), which uses Deno APIs that aren't available in the Node.js build environment.

## 🔧 **The Fix:**

Excluded the Supabase functions directory from TypeScript compilation by updating `tsconfig.json`:

### **Before:**
```json
"exclude": [
  "node_modules"
]
```

### **After:**
```json
"exclude": [
  "node_modules",
  "supabase/functions/**/*"
]
```

## 📁 **Files Updated:**

- ✅ `tsconfig.json` - Added Supabase functions to exclude list

## 🚀 **Result:**

The build should now succeed because:
- ✅ **TypeScript exclusion** - Supabase functions are no longer compiled
- ✅ **Deno APIs ignored** - Edge Function code is excluded from build
- ✅ **Clean build** - Only Next.js application code is compiled

## 💡 **Why This Works:**

Supabase Edge Functions are meant to run in the Deno runtime on Supabase's infrastructure, not in the Next.js build. By excluding them from TypeScript compilation, we prevent the build from trying to process Deno-specific code.

The deployment should now work! 🎉
