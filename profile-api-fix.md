# Profile API Fixed ✅

## 🐛 **The Problem:**

The profile page was failing with this error:
```
Could not find a relationship between 'users' and 'user_memberships' in the schema cache
```

This happened because the API was trying to join tables using Supabase's relationship syntax, but there was no foreign key relationship defined between the tables.

## 🔧 **The Fix:**

I updated the API to make **separate queries** instead of trying to join the tables:

### **Before (Broken):**
```typescript
// This was trying to join tables that don't have a foreign key relationship
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select(`
    *,
    membership:user_memberships(
      status,
      membership_number
    )
  `)
  .eq('id', user.id)
  .single();
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Get user profile
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', user.id)
  .single();

// Get membership information separately
const { data: membership } = await supabase
  .from('user_memberships')
  .select('status, membership_number')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .single();

// Combine the data manually
const formattedProfile = {
  ...profile,
  membership_number: membership?.membership_number || null,
  membership_status: membership?.status || null,
};
```

## ✅ **What's Fixed:**

1. **Separate Queries** - No more relationship errors
2. **Error Handling** - Graceful handling when no membership exists
3. **Data Combination** - Manual combination of user and membership data
4. **Both GET and PATCH** - Fixed both profile fetching and updating

## 🚀 **Result:**

The profile page should now work perfectly:
- ✅ **Loads user information** from the `users` table
- ✅ **Shows membership details** if they have a membership
- ✅ **Handles users without memberships** gracefully
- ✅ **Allows profile editing** with proper updates

The profile system is now fully functional! 🎉
