# Membership System Setup Guide

## âœ… **What We've Built:**

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/membership-plans` - Get all available membership plans
   - `/api/user-membership` - Get/create user memberships

2. **React Components**:
   - `MembershipSelector` - Beautiful membership selection interface
   - `useMembership` hook - Handles all membership operations

3. **Database Integration**:
   - Links users to membership plans
   - Tracks membership status and dates
   - Generates unique membership numbers

## ðŸš€ **Setup Steps:**

### **Step 1: Populate Membership Plans**
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard â†’ **SQL Editor**
2. Run the `populate-membership-plans.sql` script
3. This will create 3 sample membership plans

### **Step 2: Test the System**
1. **Sign up a new user** (or use existing)
2. **Go to dashboard** - you should see membership selection
3. **Select a plan** - it should save to database
4. **Refresh the page** - your membership should still be there

### **Step 3: Verify Database**
1. Go to **Table Editor** â†’ `user_memberships`
2. You should see the user's membership record
3. Check that all fields are populated correctly

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works:**

### **For New Users:**
1. User signs up and goes to dashboard
2. Sees membership plan selection
3. Selects a plan â†’ Creates record in `user_memberships`
4. Dashboard shows their selected membership

### **For Returning Users:**
1. User logs in and goes to dashboard
2. System checks if they have a membership
3. If yes â†’ Shows their current membership details
4. If no â†’ Shows membership selection

## ðŸ“Š **Database Structure:**
