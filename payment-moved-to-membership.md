## 🎯 **What I Did:**

Successfully moved all payment-related functionality from the profile page to the membership page where it makes more contextual sense.

## 📱 **Updated Membership Page Features:**

### **New Sections Added:**
- ✅ **Banking Details Management** - Add/edit/delete banking accounts

### **Removed from Profile Page:**
- ❌ Banking Details section
