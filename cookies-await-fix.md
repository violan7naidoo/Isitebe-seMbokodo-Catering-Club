# Cookies Await Fix ✅

## 🐛 **The Problem:**

TypeScript error in `src/app/api/membership/route.ts`:
```
Property 'get' does not exist on type 'Promise<ReadonlyRequestCookies>'.
```

This happened because `cookies()` returns a Promise in newer versions of Next.js, but the code was trying to use it synchronously.

## 🔧 **The Fix:**

Added `await` keyword to the `cookies()` call:

### **Before (Broken):**
```typescript
const cookieStore = cookies();
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```typescript
const cookieStore = await cookies();
```

## 📁 **File Updated:**

- ✅ `src/app/api/membership/route.ts` - Added `await` to `cookies()` call

## 🚀 **Result:**

The build should now succeed because:
- ✅ **Proper async handling** - `cookies()` is now awaited correctly
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation** - No more type errors
- ✅ **Consistent with other routes** - All API routes now use the same pattern

## 💡 **Note:**

All other API routes already had the correct `await cookies()` pattern, so only this one file needed to be fixed.

The deployment should now work! 🎉
