# Testing Authentication Flow

## Steps to Test the Fixed Authentication

1. **Set up the database table**:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Run the SQL script from `setup-users-table.sql`

2. **Test the signup flow**:
   - Go to `/auth/signup`
   - Fill out the form with your details
   - Click signup
   - Check your email for confirmation
   - Click the confirmation link

3. **Expected behavior**:
   - You should be redirected to `/dashboard` (not home page)
   - The dashboard should show "Welcome back, [Your Name]!" instead of "Welcome back, User!"
   - No more cookie errors in the console
   - User should be created in your `users` table

4. **Check the database**:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to Table Editor
   - Check the `users` table - you should see your user record

## What was fixed:

1. ✅ **Cookie handling errors** - Fixed by awaiting cookies in auth callback
2. ✅ **Redirect to home instead of dashboard** - Fixed redirect logic
3. ✅ **User metadata not being saved** - Added automatic user profile creation
4. ✅ **Display name showing as blank** - Fixed user metadata handling

## If you still have issues:

1. Check the browser console for any remaining errors
2. Verify your Supabase environment variables are correct
3. Make sure the `users` table was created successfully
4. Check that Row Level Security policies are set up correctly
