# Dashboard Navigation Added ✅

## 🎯 **What I Added:**

1. **Dashboard Link** - Added to the main navigation menu
2. **Conditional Display** - Only shows for authenticated users
3. **Mobile Support** - Works on both desktop and mobile navigation

## 📍 **Navigation Menu Now Shows:**

- **Home** (always visible)
- **About Us** (always visible)  
- **Membership** (always visible)
- **Gallery** (always visible)
- **Dashboard** (only for logged-in users) ✅

## 🔧 **How It Works:**

### **For Logged-in Users:**
- Dashboard link appears in the navigation
- Clicking it takes them to `/dashboard`
- Shows their membership status and options

### **For Non-logged-in Users:**
- Dashboard link is hidden
- They see the regular navigation (Home, About Us, Membership, Gallery)
- Dashboard is protected by authentication

## 🎨 **User Experience:**

- **Seamless Navigation** - Users can easily return to dashboard from any page
- **Clean Interface** - Dashboard link only appears when relevant
- **Mobile Friendly** - Works on all screen sizes
- **Consistent Styling** - Matches the existing navigation design

## 🚀 **Ready to Use:**

Users can now:
1. **Navigate to any page** (Home, About Us, etc.)
2. **Click "Dashboard"** to return to their membership area
3. **See their membership status** and manage their account
4. **Easily switch** between public pages and their dashboard

The Dashboard button is now live and ready for your users! 🎉
