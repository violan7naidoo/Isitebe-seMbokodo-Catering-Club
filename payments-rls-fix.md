# Payments RLS Policy Fix ✅

## 🔧 **Issue Identified:**

### **Error:** `new row violates row-level security policy for table "payments"`
- **Problem:** The `payments` table has RLS policies that are preventing payment insertion
- **Cause:** Missing or incorrect RLS policies for the payments table
- **Solution:** Create proper RLS policies that allow users to insert their own payments

## 🛠️ **Fix Applied:**

### **1. Fixed Payments Table RLS:**
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE payments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own payments" ON payments
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### **2. Fixed All Payment-Related Tables:**
- **payments** - Payment records
- **banking_details** - User banking information
- **user_memberships** - User membership data
- **user_roles** - User role assignments

### **3. Proper Permissions:**
```sql
-- Grant permissions
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO anon, authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON public.payments TO anon, authenticated;
```

## 📋 **Next Steps:**

### **1. Run the RLS Fix Script:**
1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → SQL Editor
2. **Run the contents** of `fix-all-payment-rls.sql`
3. **This will fix** all RLS policies for the payment system

### **2. Test Payment Again:**
1. **Try making a payment** again
2. **Check console logs** for any remaining errors
3. **Should now work** without RLS violations

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

- ✅ **No more RLS violations** - Policies allow payment insertion
- ✅ **Payment creation works** - Database operations complete
- ✅ **PayFast redirect** - User gets redirected to PayFast sandbox
- ✅ **Full payment flow** - Complete payment processing works

## 🚀 **What the Script Does:**

1. **Enables RLS** on all payment-related tables
2. **Drops existing policies** to avoid conflicts
3. **Creates new policies** that allow users to manage their own data
4. **Grants proper permissions** for authenticated users

The payment system should now work without any RLS policy violations! 🎉
